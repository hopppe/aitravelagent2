# Edge Function Optimization

## Problem Description

The Supabase Edge Function was encountering issues due to unnecessary database queries, token limitations, and test edge functions:

```
Edge function invocation error (will retry): Edge Function error: Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code
```

A database connection test was being run before the real job execution, and an empty test edge function file was also being deployed, causing unnecessary delays, duplicate jobs, and potential timeouts.

## Solution Summary

We've made targeted optimizations to improve reliability:

1. **Removed database test queries:** Eliminated unnecessary initial connection test that was causing delays
2. **Adjusted token limit:** Changed max_tokens to 8000 for highly detailed itineraries
3. **Changed model:** Switched from gpt-4o to gpt-3.5-turbo-16k for faster processing and larger context window
4. **Simplified JSON handling:** Kept sanitization for fixing syntax issues but removed complex logic for repairing truncated JSON
5. **Simplified the function flow:** Streamlined the execution path with fewer processing steps
6. **Removed test edge function:** Deleted an empty `test-edge-function.js` file that was being automatically deployed and potentially causing conflicts

## Technical Changes

### 1. Database Test Removal

Removed the initial database connection test that was running an unnecessary query before the actual job processing started.

### 2. OpenAI API Call Changes

```typescript
// Model and token changes
model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo-16k', // Changed from gpt-4o for faster processing
max_tokens: 8000,  // Increased to 8000 for more comprehensive itineraries
```

### 3. Simplified JSON Handling

Kept the JSON sanitization functions to fix common syntax issues like:
- Missing quotes around property names
- Single quotes instead of double quotes
- Trailing commas in arrays/objects
- JavaScript comments

But removed the complex logic that attempted to complete truncated JSON responses, allowing for more predictable processing.

### 4. Simplified Processing Flow

Streamlined the code path with direct JSON parsing and error handling, removing the truncation repair logic that could potentially cause unexpected issues while keeping the sanitization functions for common syntax errors.

### 5. Removed Test Edge Function

Deleted the empty `test-edge-function.js` file that was being automatically deployed alongside the main function and potentially causing conflicts or duplicate job runs.

## Deployment Instructions

1. Deploy the updated Edge Function with:
   ```
   supabase functions deploy generate-itinerary
   ```

2. If you can't deploy directly, manually update the function through the Supabase dashboard:
   - Navigate to Edge Functions
   - Select "generate-itinerary"
   - Paste the updated code
   - Save the changes

3. Verify that no test edge functions exist in your Supabase project dashboard

## Verification

After deployment, test the function by:

1. Creating a new trip with a detailed set of preferences
2. Monitor the Supabase Edge Function logs for any errors
3. If successful, the trip should be generated with a "completed" status and more comprehensive content

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. **Check Edge Function logs** in the Supabase dashboard
2. **Verify OpenAI API is responsive** - ensure the API key is valid and the service is available
3. **Check for Supabase storage limits** - if you encounter database storage errors, you may need to consider result size limits
4. **Verify no other test functions exist** - check your Supabase dashboard for any remaining test functions
