This file is to explain the desired display of the data
I want a title at the top with short description, we are already getting this from the ai
details is fine
then below that I want the itinerary in what looks like a widget taking up the width of the page with the days next to each other. think google calendar style, with each event on the calendar taking up its block of time and a short description by it. the time should only go from 8am-10pm. so the days are next to each other and if there are many many days you should be able to scroll sideways or click on the edge to scroll. I want color coded meals and activities having different colors.
under that two more widgets about square next to each other. one being the map and the other budget.
