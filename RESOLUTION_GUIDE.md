# Issue Resolution Guide

## Problem Identified

Based on our debugging, we identified that the Supabase Edge Function is being called successfully but isn't updating the job status after completion. The job gets stuck in the "processing" state indefinitely.

We observed:
1. Job creation works correctly
2. Status is changed to "processing" correctly
3. Edge Function is called successfully
4. However, the job never completes or fails, staying in "processing" state

## Root Causes

The most likely causes are:

1. **Edge Function Permissions**: The Edge Function might not have sufficient permissions to update the Supabase database
2. **OpenAI API Key**: The OpenAI API key might be invalid or not set in the Edge Function environment
3. **Edge Function Errors**: The Edge Function might be encountering errors that aren't being reported back
4. **Database Structure**: There might be issues with how the database is set up or accessed

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Enhanced Edge Function Logging**:
   - Added comprehensive logging throughout the Edge Function
   - Added explicit error checks and handling for each database operation
   - Added verification step to confirm status updates succeeded

2. **Job Recovery Tool**:
   - Created a utility script (`scripts/check-job-status.js`) to check and fix stuck jobs
   - This script can mark stuck jobs as "completed" or "failed"

3. **Job Status Verification**:
   - Added a verification step in the Edge Function to confirm job updates are successful

## Using the Recovery Tool

The recovery tool allows you to check any job status and fix stuck jobs:

```
node scripts/check-job-status.js <job_id> [--fix] [--status <status>]
```

For example:
```
node scripts/check-job-status.js job_1745073759779_kmiqjjt --fix --status failed
```

## Recommended Long-Term Fixes

1. **Deploy Updated Edge Function**:
   - Upload the improved Edge Function with better error handling to Supabase
   - Check the Edge Function logs in the Supabase dashboard to identify any errors

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is correctly set in the Supabase Edge Function environment
   - Verify SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are also set correctly

3. **Database Permissions**:
   - Check that the service role used by the Edge Function has permissions to update the jobs table
   - Ensure the database schema has the correct columns and constraints

4. **Error Monitoring**:
   - Add better error monitoring and alerting for stuck jobs
   - Consider implementing a job timeout mechanism to automatically fail jobs that take too long

## Testing the Fix

After implementing these changes:
1. Submit a new travel form
2. Monitor the job status to see if it completes properly
3. If it still gets stuck, check the Edge Function logs in the Supabase dashboard
4. Use the recovery tool to fix any remaining stuck jobs

Remember to deploy the updated Edge Function code to ensure these fixes take effect!
